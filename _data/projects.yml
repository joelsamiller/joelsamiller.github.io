  desc: 'Takes stereo input of video files where a flying disc is thrown, then implements a Gaussian mixture model and blob detection to identify foreground objects. A Jonker-Volgenant assignment algorithm, with cost matrix given by distances between previous and new locations, is used to track objects over time. Finally, tracks corresponding to the flying disc are de-projected to give the path in three dimensions.'
